# signal-processing-on-stm32
3 Project for Digital Signal Processing on STM32

WORK IN PROGRESS

These are my graduation thesis projects, detailed explanations can be found at https://cylnn-dev.github.io

The project folders are confusing and I don't want to change config files of the projects.

For now:

- ARMDigitalProcessing -> Baremetal UART Approach, simplest one
- audio_processing     -> Baremetal USB Approach, second project
- rtos_patched_demo    -> RTOS USB Approach, last project
